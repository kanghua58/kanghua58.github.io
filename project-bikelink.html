              This phase was all about laying the groundwork for BikeLink Pro.
              Our team engaged in intensive brainstorming sessions, aiming to
              fuse innovative technology with user-friendly design in an e-bike.
              We delved into various concepts, considering different aspects
              such as autonomy level, user interface, and environmental impact.
              The focus was on ideating a product that not only aligned with
              Ford's vision but also addressed real user needs.

            <p>
              To ensure our design was grounded in real-world context, we
              conducted guerrilla research. This involved impromptu interviews
              and observations in public spaces where e-bikes were commonly
              used. Insights about user behaviors, preferences, and pain points
              were gathered. This approach provided us with a raw, unfiltered

              about the specific class of e-bike BikeLink Pro would belong to.
              We settled on a Class-3 e-bike, offering pedal assistance up to 28
              mph. This decision was influenced by factors like the need for
              versatility in different riding scenarios and the desire to cater
              to both leisure and commute purposes.The final aspect of our
              initial research phase was selecting the features that BikeLink
              Pro would offer. Our choices were deeply influenced by our
              research findings. We prioritized features that enhanced safety,
              user experience, and environmental friendliness. This included
              decisions about the bike's power modes, user interface design, and
              additional smart features like GPS navigation and social
              connectivity.

              Challenges encountered during the prototyping phase included
              finding the right materials for durability and aesthetics,
              integrating the digital interface with physical controls
              seamlessly, and ensuring the prototype was representative of the
              final product. These were addressed through material testing,
              design adjustments, and constant evaluation against our design
              goals. Special attention was given to how users interacted with
              the physical controls. This included the tactile feel of buttons,
              the responsiveness of control mechanisms, and the intuitiveness of
              the layout. The design aimed to make the riding experience as
              comfortable and effortless as possible.

              Final Physical Prototype: A Fusion of Form and Function
            </h1>
            <p>
              After we completed revamping our digital interface, we explored
              one final suggestion that arose when a user inquired about the
              potential inclusion of haptic feedback for enhanced interaction.
              This sparked an idea within the team to add a haptic feedback
              circuit aimed at augmenting the user experience during prototype
              evaluation. We made a quick and simple circuit using a breadboard,
              2 vibration motors (and buttons), a 9v alkaline battery and an
              array of wires to simulate the haptic feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once we had this haptic feedback mounted on our bike, we thought
              of how the user would experience this feedback and in what
              conditions. For instance, when the user is trying to make a turn,
              and there is a vehicle approaching from behind, the user should
              experience vibrations on the side of the handle where they are
              trying to make the turn to alert them. Likewise, we integrated
              this haptic feedback concept into our designs at various instances
              within the user flow.

                Recording and Revisiting Insights</span
              >
              - Taking thorough notes and recording insights during research
              phases are crucial for ensuring that product design remains
              purpose-focused. Our primary goal was to create an eco-friendly,
              energy-efficient, and, most importantly, safe semi-autonomous
              e-bike. However, during iterations 1 through 3, we found ourselves
              overly focused on the visual aspects of the dashboard design,
              which led us to temporarily lose sight of these core objectives.
              Revisiting our initial insights, particularly after the Rose,
              Thorn, and Buds session, realigned our focus and guided us back on
              track.

                >Conduct Tests with Diverse User Groups</span
              >
              - Conducting tests with diverse user groups is vital for obtaining
              comprehensive feedback on design effectiveness. For instance,
              during user testing at Tepper, we observed varied responses: an
              experienced e-bike rider appreciated the design and found the user
              flow smooth, whereas another participant, less familiar with
              e-bikes, raised fundamental questions about e-bike functionality.
              This highlighted the need to provide contextual information and a
              detailed walkthrough of the interface components for novice users.
              Encouraging users to verbalize their perceptions before testing
              tasks ensures they have a correct understanding of the interface.
              It was also through testing with less experienced user groups that
              we realized the importance of adding flashing indicators to hold
              on to the handle bar/putting the feet on the ground during
              emergency.

                >Feeling stuck? Go back to Sketching</span
              >
              - Sketching emerges as a valuable tool, especially when facing
              design challenges. It facilitates the rapid generation of new
              layouts, allowing for easy comparison and selection of the most
              effective design. However, there's a risk of becoming overly
              attached to a design once it's visualized in a tool like Figma,
              leading to a narrow view of possible solutions. Returning to
              sketching can stimulate out-of-the-box thinking.

              <span class="highlight-blue">How to get inspired</span> -
              Innovating and differentiating the product requires creative
              thinking and the development of new paradigms. For example, I got
              the idea of adding the auto parking feature by watching YouTube
              videos of autonomous auto bikes.The most effective strategies for
              innovation often involve hands-on experience with existing
              products to identify gaps and conducting interviews with
              experienced users and designers. This approach fosters a deeper
              understanding of user needs and industry trends, driving the
              creation of a unique and effective product.
