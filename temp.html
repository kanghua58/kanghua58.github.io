    <h1 class="descriptive-block">Critical Decision</h1>
    <p>
      One of the most critical decisions was to implement a simplified digital
      map that displayed nearby users as avatars. This feature will
      differentiate Vibely from conventional dating app features while
      introducing a novel way for users to visualize and interact with their
      surroundings. Another significant decision was to enable notifications for
      when a match was within a 0.5-mile radius. This would add a layer of
      immediacy and excitement to potential encounters.
      <br /><br />
      Throughout the design process, I connected with users to gather their
      thoughts on the nascent Vibely feature. Hannah, one of the users I matched
      with, shared her excitement about the feature, her messages brimming with
      enthusiasm for the real-time map concept.
      <span class="italic-yellow"
        >"Seeing who's nearby feels like a fresh twist to online dating. It
        makes connections feel more tangible,"</span
      >
      she wrote. <br /><br />
      The dialogue on proximity alerts took an interesting turn during a chat
      with another user, Alex. He remarked,
      <span class="italic-yellow"
        >"Getting a ping when a potential match is just around the corner might
        be the spontaneity we need! </span
      >ðŸ¤”<span class="italic-yellow">"</span> capturing the essence of
      excitement the notification feature could bring. <br /><br />
      However, it was my chat with Matt that introduced a critical perspective
      on one of Vibely's engagement mechanisms. Matt, a user that shines with
      his thoughtful and detailed messages, expressed concerns about the initial
      requirement of exchanging 20 messages to establish a match.
      <span class="italic-yellow"
        >"I tend to write longer, more meaningful messages,"</span
      >
      he explained,
      <span class="italic-yellow"
        >"and reaching a 20-message threshold in just 5 minutes feels a bit
        daunting. It might discourage deeper conversations from the
        get-go."</span
      >
      <br /><br />
      These virtual conversations with Bumble users provided invaluable
      insights. Hannah and Alex's enthusiasm validated the feature's novel
      approach to enhancing user interaction, while Matt's feedback prompted a
      reevaluation of engagement thresholds, ensuring that Vibely would cater to
      a diverse range of communication styles within the Bumble community.

    <h1 class="descriptive-block">Design Evolution</h1>
    <p>
      The journey to refine Vibely was marked by a series of user testing
      sessions, each one unveiling key insights that shaped the feature's
      evolution.
      <br /><br />
      To further enrich the user experience and boost engagement, I looked to
      Duolingo for inspiration and introduced interactive widgets and timely
      notifications. These widgets dynamically adapt, reflecting the vibe of
      nearby users and the time of day, creating a more personalized and
      responsive ecosystem.
      <br /><br />
      The addition of an optional tagline input came directly from user
      feedback. Raquel, another tester, suggested,
      <span class="italic-yellow"
        >"It'd be cool to have a bit of text, something fun or quirky that shows
        what I'm about or what I'm looking for."</span
      >
      This feature allowed users to express their intentions or mood beyond just
      the avatar, adding depth to their digital presence. This switch from real
      names to aliases was another pivotal change informed by user feedback.
      <span class="italic-yellow"
        >"I like the idea of a bit of mystery, using an alias makes it feel
        safer and more intriguing."</span
      >
      <br /><br />
      The onboarding experience was also revamped. Initially, some users like
      Linxi struggled to grasp the full breadth of Vibely's capabilities without
      guidance. This led to the introduction of onboarding screens that
      succinctly communicated the feature's essence and how to navigate it.
      <br /><br />
      Lastly, the concept of sending flowers as a gesture of interest was born
      out of the playful scenario I set for the user flow where a hypothecital
      character Kay sets her avatar holding a bouquet in her hands meets Allison
      and asked her out. Mason, who mused,
      <span class="italic-yellow"
        >"What if I actually could send those flowers I'm holding in my
        avatar?"</span
      >
      This idea not only resonated with our team but also presented a novel
      conversion point. I iterated on this, integrating a feature that allowed
      users to send virtual flowers to one another, adding a layer of
      interaction and potential for engagement. <br /><br />
      Each iteration inspired by direct user input and creative solutions to
      their feedback, moved it closer to a feature that was not only intuitive
      and engaging but also resonant more with the users' desire for meaningful
      and dynamic connections.

    <h1 class="descriptive-block">Intent and Motivation</h1>
    <p>
      The evolution of Vibely's design was driven by a commitment to transcend
      the superficial engagement often found in the fast-paced realm of
      swipe-based dating apps. This helps to introduce a layer of authenticity
      and connection missing in modern digital interactions. Transitioning from
      a conventional map to a more abstract, user-friendly layout, the goal was
      to simplify the digital landscape, creating a space that feels welcoming
      and easy to explore. The main interaction paradigm of the 5-minute chat
      was a deliberate effort to infuse real-time excitement and promptness into
      user interactions, encouraging meaningful exchanges that go beyond
      surface-level connections.
