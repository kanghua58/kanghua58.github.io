        <h1 class="descriptive-block">A Map Feature Based on Geolocation</h1>
        <p>
          This project embarked on the creation of Vibely, a map feature within
          the Bumble dating app designed to transform how users connect by
          leveraging real-time location services. The intent was to enhance the
          digital interaction experience. <br /><br />

          By allowing users to create and customize avatars reflecting their
          mood or preferred activities, complete with unique catchphrases,
          Vibely adds a new dimension of personal expression to the Bumble
          profile. This interactive map showcases nearby users as animated
          avatars, making the digital space feel more tangible and connected.

                <h1 class="descriptive-block">Data-informed Design Decision</h1>
                <p>
                  This exploratory stage entailed a thorough examination of existing user behavior patterns, preferences, and the inherent constraints within the traditional frameworks of online dating. Key activities during this phase included comprehensive brainstorming sessions aimed at ideation, an in-depth competitive analysis to understand the market landscape, and the development of initial concept ideas. These ideas were then subjected to iterative feedback loops, allowing for the refinement of user flows and the overall concept idea for Vibely.
                  <br><br>
                  In addition to qualitative insights, a exploratory analysis of user data was conducted to inform my approach further. This analysis revealed two critical insights that shaped the development of Vibely:
                  <br><br>
                  <span class="highlight-yellow">Trend in Conversion Rates</span>: There was a noticeable decline in conversion rates over time, indicating a potential loss of user engagement or interest as they continued to use the app. This trend highlighted the need for a feature that could reinvigorate user interest and engagement. This makes a strong case for the introduction of an innovative feature like Vibely.
                  <br><br>
                  <span class="highlight-yellow">Impact of User Interactions on Conversions</span>: Data showed a positive correlation between the number of interactions and conversion rates. Users who engaged more frequently with others were more likely to convert to paid services. This insight underscored the importance of designing Vibely to facilitate and encourage increased interactions among users, reinforcing the concept that more dynamic and engaging features could drive higher conversion rates.
                  <br><br>
                  Armed with these insights, the design and development of Vibely were aligned to enhance the quality of user interactions within Bumble and to address the identified trends in user engagement and conversion, ensuring that the new feature would contribute positively to the user experience and the business metrics.

                <p>
                  Every step of the design process was anchored in a commitment to elevating the user experience and fostering greater engagement. Each aspect of Vibely, from the personal touch of avatar customization to the immediacy of real-time notifications, was thoughtfully examined to ensure it resonated with the users' needs and aligned with Bumble's strategic vision. I made it a point to continuously refine the design brief, integrating fresh insights from user interviews to ensure that the project remained on course and didn't become a reflection of my personal biases. The introduction of emoji avatars and system-generated aliases, for instance, was a strategic move aimed at safeguarding privacy while simultaneously building a sense of community and enhancing the joy of the user experience.

                <p>
                  In addressing the unique challenges faced by new Bumble users, especially those in smaller cities or hesitant to invest in premium features, a focused approach to problem framing was essential. The core issues identified included a lack of matches and a limited exploration of the app's capabilities. In smaller towns where the user base is naturally smaller, the app's standard recommendation algorithms that prioritize geographical proximity, might not serve these users well. Additionally, the hesitation to spend on premium features like spotlights, coupled with the frustration of running out of likes without successful matches, further compounded the challenge.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>To tackle these issues while leveraging geo-location functionality, four innovative concept ideas were brainstormed:</p>
                <p>
                <ul class="role-list-yellow">
                  <li><span class="highlight-yellow">Buzz Alerts</span>: This feature would leverage real-time notifications to alert users when a highly compatible potential match is nearby, enhancing the spontaneity and relevance of connections.
                  </li>
                  <li><span class="highlight-yellow">Mood-Based Matching</span>: Going beyond mere geographical proximity, this concept proposed matching users based on their current mood or desired activity, adding depth to the matching process.
                  </li>
                  <li><span class="highlight-yellow">Flash Gather</span>: Aimed at facilitating immediate social interactions, Flash Gather would enable users to organize or join short-notice meetups with nearby members who share similar interests, perfect for impromptu coffee breaks or lunch dates. </li>
                 
                  <li><span class="highlight-yellow">Path Crosser</span>: By highlighting users whose paths you've crossed during the day, this feature aimed to create a sense of familiarity and serendipity, potentially making the digital connection feel more grounded in the real world.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                After consideration on feasibility, a decision was made to combine the strengths of the first three concepts—Buzz Alerts, Mood-Based Matching, and Flash Gather—into one cohesive prototype.
              </p>

                <p>
                  In crafting Vibely's unique appeal, a pivotal decision was the introduction of a streamlined digital map showcasing nearby users through avatars. This innovative feature was designed to set Vibely apart from traditional dating apps, offering a fresh perspective on user interaction within their local environment. Complementing this, we integrated notifications alerting users when a match was within a half-mile radius, injecting a sense of immediacy and thrill into potential meetings.</p> 
                  <p>Throughout the design process, I connected with users to gather their
                  thoughts on the nascent Vibely feature. Hannah (pseudonym, the same below), one of the users I matched
                  with, shared her excitement about the feature, her messages brimming with
                  enthusiasm for the real-time map concept.
                  <span class="italic-yellow">"Seeing who's nearby feels like a fresh twist to online dating. It makes connections feel more tangible,"</span> she wrote.</p> 
                  <P>Despite the positive reception, it became clear that the visualization of users' avatars based on proximity wasn't as intuitive as expected. To address this, I refined the user interface by incorporating a dynamic loading animation and a more prominent display of distances on the main map view. These enhancements aimed to clarify the spatial relationship between users. </P>

                  The dialogue on proximity alerts took an interesting turn during a chat
                  with another user, Alex. He remarked,

                  his thoughtful and detailed messages, expressed concerns about the initial
                  requirement of exchanging 20 messages to establish a match.

              insights. Hannah and Alex's enthusiasm validated the feature's novel
              approach to enhancing user interaction, while Matt's feedback prompted a
              reevaluation of engagement thresholds, ensuring that Vibely would cater to
              a diverse range of communication styles within the Bumble community.</p>

                  To further enrich the user experience and boost engagement, I looked to
                  Duolingo for inspiration and introduced interactive widgets and timely
                  notifications. These widgets dynamically adapt, reflecting the vibe of
                  nearby users and the time of day, creating a more personalized and
                  responsive ecosystem.

                  The addition of an optional tagline input came directly from user
                  feedback. Raquel, another tester, suggested,
                  <span class="italic-yellow"
                    >"It'd be cool to have a bit of text, something fun or quirky that shows

                  >
                  This feature allowed users to express their intentions or mood beyond just
                  the avatar, adding depth to their digital presence. This switch from real
                  names to aliases was another pivotal change informed by user feedback.
                  <span class="italic-yellow"
                    >"I like the idea of a bit of mystery, using an alias makes it feel
                    safer and more intriguing."</span

                  The onboarding experience was also revamped. Initially, some users like
                  Linxi struggled to grasp the full breadth of Vibely's capabilities without
                  guidance. This led to the introduction of onboarding screens that
                  succinctly communicated the feature's essence and how to navigate it.

                  The concept of sending flowers as a gesture of interest was born
                  out of the playful scenario I set for the user flow where a hypothecital
                  character Kay sets her avatar holding a bouquet in her hands meets Allison
                  and asked her out. Mason, who mused,
                  <span class="italic-yellow"
                    >"What if I actually could send those flowers I'm holding in my
                    avatar?"</span
                  >
                  This idea resonated with me and presented a novel
                  conversion point. I iterated on this, integrating a feature that allowed
                  users to send virtual flowers to one another, adding a layer of
                  interaction and potential for engagement.

            <p>Each iteration inspired by direct user input and creative solutions to
              their feedback, moved Vibely closer to a feature that is more intuitive, 
              engaging ,and also resonant more with the users' desire for meaningful
              and dynamic connections.</p>

                  The evolution of Vibely's design was driven by a commitment to transcend
                  the superficial engagement often found in the fast-paced realm of
                  swipe-based dating apps. This helps to introduce a layer of authenticity
                  and connection missing in modern digital interactions. Transitioning from
                  a conventional map to a more abstract, user-friendly layout, the goal was
                  to simplify the digital landscape, creating a space that feels welcoming
                  and easy to explore. The main interaction paradigm of the 5-minute chat
                  was a deliberate effort to infuse real-time excitement and promptness into
                  user interactions, encouraging meaningful exchanges that go beyond
                  surface-level connections.

        <h1 class="title-yellow">4. Design Systems, Microinteractions, Artifacts and User</h1>
        <div class="image-plus">
          <div class="col16 plus-description-left">
            <p>
              Diving into the Vibely voyage has been nothing short of an adventure. I was able to apply what I learnt about design systems and design principles into practice while having fun exploring the interaction paradigms of dating apps.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="descriptive-block paddingtop20">Leveraging Design Systems</h1>
            <p>
              Reflecting on the use of Uber's Base design system, the well-defined color system was a significant time-saver, streamlining the design process and ensuring visual consistency. However, the lack of icons within Base posed a challenge. I ended up using Google Material Symbols to fill the gap.Furthermore, merging Base's elements with the Bumble interface proved difficult, necessitating numerous customizations to align with Bumble's overall aesthetic. This experience highlighted the balance between leveraging a design system for efficiency and the need for adaptability in integrating it with existing interfaces.
            </p>
            <h1 class="descriptive-block paddingtop20">The Magic of Microinteractions</h1>
            <p>
              Oh, the thrill of sprinkling a little magic of microinteractions into Vibely! There were numerous instances where I found myself switching between the subtle magic of 'smart-animate' and the gentle glide of 'slide-in', all in the quest for that perfectly smooth user experience. And then there was the charming moment when a tiny car made its way from a quaint green palace to a more majestic red one, a clever way to invite users to explore the premium side of things. It was like a friendly nudge, "Shall we venture further?"
              <br><br>
              The challenge of asking users to share their location or perhaps invest a bit more in a new feature could easily have been a point of contention. Yet, by weaving in these microinteractions, what might have been a moment of hesitation became an engaging, almost playful, interaction. It was a gentle reminder that even the smallest of touches can make the digital experience a lot more inviting.
            </p>
            <h1 class="descriptive-block paddingtop20">Dancing with the Competitors</h1>
            <p>
              Venturing into design without peeking at the competition felt like tightrope walking without a net — thrilling yet daunting. I took the road less traveled by saving the part of the competitive analysis for later. This strategy paid off, keeping my creative wells unpolluted. When I finally scoped out the scene (hello, Badoo and your mood-based matching!), it was with a treasure trove of original ideas in hand. This approach of ideation before investigation is one I'd take away for future projects.
            </p>
            <h1 class="descriptive-block paddingtop20">A Lesson in Listening</h1>
            <p>
              The allure of a real map feature was almost irresistible! As a habitual "yes" person to app permissions, I initially underestimated the privacy red flags. But, a chat with seasoned Bumble bees taught me a valuable lesson: privacy is paramount (turns out, 3 out of 4 users echo this sentiment). This epiphany led to a creative pivot in how the map was presented, underscoring the golden rule: user feedback is the north star that guides the journey of innovation. A callback to last semester's semi-autonomous vehicle interaction design reflection on involving the user at earlier stages - embracing user insights at every twist was pivotal in molding Vibely into a feature that truly goes belonged.
