        <h1 class="descriptive-block">A Map Feature Based on Geolocation</h1>
        <p>
          This project embarked on the creation of Vibely, a map feature within
          the Bumble dating app designed to transform how users connect by
          leveraging real-time location services. The intent was to enhance the
          digital interaction experience. <br /><br />

          By allowing users to create and customize avatars reflecting their
          mood or preferred activities, complete with unique catchphrases,
          Vibely adds a new dimension of personal expression to the Bumble
          profile. This interactive map showcases nearby users as animated
          avatars, making the digital space feel more tangible and connected.

        <div class="image-plus">
          <img class="col8" src="./image/vibely/" alt="" />
          <div class="col8 plus-description">
            <h1 class="descriptive-block">Approach</h1>
            <p>
              The initial approach was methodical and user-centric. I started
              by identifying the core need for deeper, more meaningful
              interactions within the app. This involved analyzing current user
              behaviors, preferences, and the limitations of existing digital
              dating paradigms. Foundational steps included brainstorming
              sessions, competitive analysis, and crafting and receiving feedbacks on concept ideas and user flows to conceptualize the new feature.

          <div class="col8 plus-description">
            <h1 class="descriptive-block">Desicion Making</h1>
            <p>
              Decisions throughout the design process were guided by a
              commitment to enhancing user experience and engagement. Each
              feature of Vibely, from avatar customization to real-time
              notifications, was carefully considered to ensure it aligned with
              user needs and Bumble's strategic objectives. The choice to
              incorporate emoji avatars and system-generated aliases, for
              example, was driven by the desire to keep the privacy hats on while
              fostering a sense of community and belonging while amping up user joy.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="image-plus">
          <img class="col8" src="./image/vibely/" alt="" />
          <div class="col8 plus-description">
            <h1 class="descriptive-block">Critical Decision</h1>
            <p>
              One of the most critical decisions was to implement a simplified
              digital map that displayed nearby users as avatars. This not only
              differentiated Vibely from conventional dating app features but
              also introduced a novel way for users to visualize and interact
              with their surroundings. Another significant decision was to
              enable notifications for when a match was within a 0.5-mile
              radius, adding a layer of immediacy and excitement to potential
              encounters. 
              <br><br>
              During a series of engaging chats on Bumble, I connected with users to gather their candid thoughts on the nascent Vibely feature. Hannah, one of the users I encountered, shared her excitement about the feature, her messages brimming with enthusiasm for the real-time map concept. <span class="italic-yellow">"Seeing who's nearby with just a glance feels like a fresh twist to online dating. It's like blending the digital with the real, making connections feel more tangible,"</span> she typed.
              <br><br>
              The conversation about proximity alerts with Alex, another user, unfolded in a similar digital space. His responses were thoughtful, punctuated by emojis that conveyed his intrigue saying<span class="italic-yellow">"Getting a ping when a potential match is just around the corner might be the spontaneity we need!"</span>.
              <br><br>
              However, it was my chat with Matt that introduced a critical perspective on one of Vibely's engagement mechanisms. Matt, a user that shines with his thoughtful and detailed messages, expressed concerns about the initial requirement of exchanging 20 messages to establish a match. <span class="italic-yellow">"I tend to write longer, more meaningful messages,"</span> he explained, <span class="italic-yellow">"and reaching a 20-message threshold in just 5 minutes feels a bit daunting. It might discourage deeper conversations from the get-go."</span>
              <br><br>
              These virtual conversations, unfolding in the very environment where Vibely would come to life, provided invaluable insights. Hannah and Alex's enthusiasm validated the feature's novel approach to enhancing user interaction, while Matt's feedback prompted a reevaluation of engagement thresholds, ensuring that Vibely would cater to a diverse range of communication styles within the Bumble community.

        <div class="image-plus">

          />
          <div class="col8 plus-description">
            <h1 class="descriptive-block">Design Evolution</h1>
            <p>
              The journey to refine Vibely was marked by a series of user testing sessions, each one unveiling key insights that shaped the feature's evolution.
              <br><br>
              To enhance the ecosystem and user engagement, I drew inspiration from Duolingo, introducing widgets and notifications.
              <br><br>
              The addition of an optional catchphrase input came directly from user feedback. Raquel, another tester, suggested, <span class="italic-yellow">"It'd be cool to have a bit of text, something fun or quirky that shows what I'm about or what I'm looking for."</span> This feature allowed users to express their intentions or mood beyond just the avatar, adding depth to their digital presence.
              <br><br>
              Switching from real names to aliases was another pivotal change informed by user feedback. <span class="italic-yellow">"I like the idea of a bit of mystery, using an alias makes it feel safer and more intriguing."</span>
              <br><br>
              The onboarding experience was also revamped. Initially, some users like Linxi struggled to grasp the full breadth of Vibely's capabilities without guidance. This led to the introduction of onboarding screens that succinctly communicated the feature's essence and how to navigate it.
              <br><br>
              Lastly, the concept of sending flowers as a gesture of interest was born out of the playful scenario I set for the user flow, Mason, who mused, <span class="italic-yellow">"What if I actually could send those flowers I'm holding in my avatar?"</span> This idea not only resonated with our team but also presented a novel conversion point. I iterated on this, integrating a feature that allowed users to send virtual flowers to one another, adding a layer of interaction and potential for engagement.
              <br><br>
              Each iteration of Vibely, enriched by direct user input and creative solutions to their feedback, moved it closer to a feature that was not only intuitive and engaging but also resonant more with the users' desire for meaningful and dynamic connections.

            <h1 class="descriptive-block">Intent and Motivation</h1>
            <p>The evolution of Vibely's design was driven by a commitment to transcend the superficial engagement often found in the fast-paced realm of swipe-based dating apps, aiming to introduce a layer of authenticity and connection missing in modern digital interactions. Transitioning from a conventional map to a more abstract, user-friendly layout, the goal was to simplify the digital landscape, creating a space that feels welcoming and easy to explore. The launch of features such as the 5-minute chat was a deliberate effort to infuse real-time excitement and promptness into user interactions, encouraging meaningful exchanges that go beyond surface-level connections. Every tweak and enhancement to Vibely was implemented to ensure it meets the users' desire for genuine connection and to improve their experience within the Bumble ecosystem.

              Diving into the Vibely voyage has been nothing short of an adventure, brimming with eye-opening revelations and bursts of creativity.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="descriptive-block">A Lesson in Listening</h1>
            <p>
              The allure of a real map feature was almost irresistible! As a habitual "yes" person to app permissions, I initially underestimated the privacy red flags. But, a chat with seasoned Bumble bees taught me a valuable lesson: privacy is paramount (turns out, 3 out of 4 users echo this sentiment). This epiphany led to a creative pivot in how the map was presented, underscoring the golden rule: user feedback is the north star that guides the journey of innovation. <br>Embracing user insights at every twist and turn was pivotal in molding Vibely into a feature that didn't just exist but truly belonged.
            </p>
            <h1 class="descriptive-block paddingtop20">The Magic of Microinteractions</h1>
            <p>
              Oh, the joy of weaving microinteractions into Vibely’s fabric! Tinkering in Figma to breathe life into animations was like being a kid in a digital candy store. This playful exploration reaffirmed that the delight is in the details, with each interaction harmoniously choreographed to craft a seamless user journey.
            </p>
            <h1 class="descriptive-block paddingtop20">Dancing with the Competitors</h1>
            <p>
              Venturing into design without peeking at the competition felt like tightrope walking without a net — thrilling yet daunting. I took the road less traveled by saving the part of the competitive analysis for later. This strategy paid off, keeping my creative wells unpolluted. When I finally scoped out the scene (hello, Badoo and your mood-based matching!), it was with a treasure trove of original ideas in hand. This approach of ideation before investigation is one I'd take away for future projects.
