          The Problem: People find it hard to move towards long-term goals

        <p>
          Many individuals struggle to follow through on their New Year's
          resolutions, particularly those related to fitness and health. This
          common challenge can be attributed to several learning gaps, including
          a lack of proper goal-setting skills, difficulty in maintaining
          motivation, and limited knowledge of effective strategies for
          achieving long-term objectives. These learning gaps affect a wide
          range of stakeholders, from young adults to working professionals and
          retirees, who find themselves falling short of their fitness goals
          despite their initial enthusiasm and commitment.

          Through structured interview with 4 learner with varying levels of

          example, has a lot of fitness knowledge but struggles with execution
          due to time constraints and other priorities. On the other hand, the
          Adaptive Fitness Enthusiast is more flexible in their approach to
          fitness and doesn't adhere to a strict schedule, while the Determined
          Busy Health Seeker tends to get discouraged if they don't see quick
          results. Lastly, the Spontaneous Fitness Beginner is new to fitness
          and acknowledges that staying consistent will be a challenge. These

          Our learner persona, Ken, is a representative of our target audience.
          Ken is a busy professional who sets high standards for himself but
          often feels disappointed when he fails to meet his fitness goals. This
          negatively impacts his motivation to continue, and his busy schedule
          and tendency to procrastinate make it difficult for him to stay
          accountable and make consistent progress. We chose to focus on the
          domain of fitness because it is a common area of interest for many
          individuals, and the challenges faced by Ken are representative of
          those experienced by a significant portion of our target audience.

          physical health and well-being. Poor physical health and well-being
          can lead to a range of negative outcomes, including increased risk of
          chronic diseases, reduced quality of life, and increased healthcare
          costs. By helping individuals like Ken develop effective goal-setting
          skills, we can empower them to take control of their health and
          well-being, leading to better long-term outcomes and a higher quality
          of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Effective goal-setting skills provide individuals with direction,
          motivation, and a sense of purpose in their fitness journey. The
          absence of well-defined goals can make it difficult to measure success
          and adjust strategies when necessary, potentially leading to
          frustration and disengagement from fitness activities altogether.

          Our Goal: Help Learner Set and Achieve Fitness Goals
        </h1>
        <p>
          The primary goal of our project is to develop an AI-powered learning
          tool, PlanPal, that addresses the learning gaps identified above. We
          aimed to create a mobile app that provides personalized guidance and
          support to help users set and achieve their fitness goals. By
          leveraging AI technology and evidence-based learning strategies, we
          sought to create an engaging and effective learning experience that
          empowers individuals to develop the skills and knowledge necessary for
          long-term success in their fitness journey. Ultimately, our goal was
          to make a meaningful impact on the lives of our users by helping them
          overcome the common challenges associated with New Year's resolutions
          and achieve their health and wellness objectives.

        <h1 class="descriptive-block">More Effective User Testing</h1>
        <p>
          Moving forward, the logical next steps in studying PlanPal's
          effectiveness would be to implement pre- and post-tests with short
          answer questions and grading rubrics to measure learning gains. This
          process will provide a clearer understanding of the app's impact on
          users' knowledge and skills related to goal-setting and achievement.

        <h1 class="descriptive-block">Scaling to Goal Setting in Any Domain</h1>
        <p>
          The design approach used in PlanPal has broad implications and
          applications beyond the domain of fitness. The principles and
          strategies employed could be adapted to support goal-setting and
          achievement in various areas, such as education, personal development,
          career growth, and relationships. Looking into the near future, by
          incorporating data-driven algorithms and more advanced large language
          models, PlanPal as a learning tool could have the potential to enhance
          goal accomplishment universally, leading to improved outcomes at a
          larger scale.

        <h1 class="descriptive-block">Takeaways</h1>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Leveraging AI to Simulate Social Presence</h2>
        <p>
          PlanPal harnesses the power of AI to create a sense of social
          presence, which has been shown to enhance goal performance. By making
          goals public to AI coaches that simulate real-life accountability
          partners, users feel more committed and motivated to achieve their
          objectives. This approach taps into the human need for social support
          and encouragement.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">
          Best Practices and Pitfalls of AI in Educational Contexts
        </h2>
        <p>
          As AI continues to revolutionize the educational landscape, it is
          crucial to understand the best practices and potential pitfalls of
          incorporating this technology into learning experiences. PlanPal
          serves as a valuable case study. It would be intriguing to see the app
          being developed and run experiments with.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Working with My Team</h2>
        <p>
          Collaborating with a diverse and talented team has been a key factor
          in the success of the PlanPal project. My teammate Sherry, a
          graduating industrial design student with expertise in prototyping
          tools, brought a unique perspective and skill set to the table. As
          someone with a background in learning science and interaction design,
          our abilities complemented each other nicely.
