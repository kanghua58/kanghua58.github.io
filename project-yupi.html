        <h1 class="title-purple">2. Why the Urgent Care</h1>
        <p>
          We were tasked to enhance accessibility in a public space, making
          these areas more inclusive and user-friendly for everyone, regardless
          of their abilities, by leverage new technologies including
          conversational agent and smart materials.
        </p>
        <h1 class="descriptive-block">Auditing current experience</h1>
        <p>
          We visited the most popular urgent care clinics here at Pittsburgh
          including MinuteClinic at CVS, Concentra Urgent Care, Medexpress
          Urgent Care and UPMC Urgent Care.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Difficulty in navigating information</h2>
        <p>
          The clinicians were all very busy. We have to wait for a long time
          standing in line before talking to them to get more information about
          the treatment process.
        </p>
        <img class="col16" src="./image/yupi/7.png" alt="" />

        <h2 class="subtitle">Limited Support and Long Wait Time</h2>
        <p>
          As I stepped into the urgent care facility, I couldn't help but feel a
          sense of unease wash over me. The waiting room was bustling with
          activity, and the chairs looked like they had seen better days.
        </p>
        <p>
          I settled into one of the uncomfortable chairs, trying to distract
          myself from the loud noise that seemed to emanate from every corner of
          the room. I couldn't help but notice the idle kiosk at UPMC Shadyside,
          which seemed to be the only clinic equipped with such technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the minutes turned into hours, I found myself growing increasingly
          restless. The uncertainty of the wait was almost as uncomfortable as
          the chair I was sitting in. Finally, my name was called, and I was
          ushered into the doctor's office. But even then, there was no
          communication about how much longer I would have to wait before the
          doctor would actually see me.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the clinician finally arrived. However, I quickly found myself
          struggling to understand the questions being asked. The medical jargon
          and technical terms were like another foreign language to me, and as
          someone who speaks English as a second language, it only added to my
          confusion and frustration.
        </p>
        <img class="col16" src="./image/yupi/8.png" alt="" />

        <h1 class="descriptive-block">Mapping Pain Points</h1>
        <p>
          We all recalled numerous moments of frustration going to Urgent Care
          that we experienced ourselves or heard from others. We mapped out
          these pain points to help us focus on the problems worth solving and
          technically feasible (Problem Space).

        <img class="col16" src="./image/yupi/problem_space.png" alt="" />

        <h1 class="descriptive-block">
          Speculating how conversational agent would improve the situations
        </h1>
        <p>
          Based on the insights form the pain point mapping, we could come up
          with the features that YUPI would help with and the modality with
          which patients and clinicians would interact with YUPI to use the
          features throughout the urgent care visit.

        <h1 class="title-purple">
          3. Ideation: From Masks to Robots to the ecosystem
        </h1>
        <p>
          Our design journey began with a smart mask to enhance patient-provider
          communication through translation and voice amplification. However,
          user feedback revealed accessibility issues, hygiene concerns, and
          political complications surrounding mask usage. These challenges
          prompted us to pivot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, we explored robotics to revolutionize healthcare interactions.
          Autonomous robots could assist with navigation, information, and
          translation. Yet, high costs and the importance of human connection in
          healthcare, as emphasized by patients, led us to reconsider. Insights
          from user interviews brought to light this crucial aspect of
          healthcare: the human touch. One patient insightfully remarked, "It's
          comforting to talk to real humans, not robots, especially when you're
          worried about your health." This sentiment was echoed widely,
          reminding us that technology should enhance, not replace, the human
          elements of care.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pivotal feedback shaped our final pivot to the YUPI ecosystem.
          Incorporating smart pins, mobile apps, and integrated clinic systems,
          YUPI ensures accessibility, hygiene, and the invaluable human touch at
          every interaction point. This journey underscores the importance of
          user-centered design in creating meaningful healthcare solutions.

        <p>
          YUPI‚Äòs mission is to ensure everyone can navigate healthcare
          environments more autonomously. Looking into the future, YUPI Pin
          could be introduced with computer vision that interprets sign
          language.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make YUPI a scalable, universally integrated solution within
          existing healthcare frameworks requires that YUPI can seamlessly
          interact with various healthcare systems, with unfortunately is a
          problem that has never been tackled in the past years despite
          countless attempts. That being said, the vision for YUPI is to create
          a healthcare environment where every patient, no matter their ability,
          feels understood, valued, and cared for, which we believe is
          achieveable given time and effort.

        <img class="col16" src="./image/yupi/accessibility.png" alt="" />
        <h1 class="descriptive-block">Marketing Strategies</h1>
        <p>
          When using "YUPI" in marketing materials, emphasize should be placed
          on key features, such as 24/7 availability, quick response times, and
          accurate information. It's crutial to also encourage natural language
          interaction, highlighting YUPI's ability to understand and respond to
          users effectively.
        </p>
        <img class="col16" src="./image/yupi/marketing.png" alt="" />
        <h1 class="descriptive-block">Takeaways</h1>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Designing Conversations</h2>
        <p>
          When creating conversations for YUPI, we had to consider linguistic
          nuances, cultural sensitivities, and technical accuracy, ensuring that
          YUPI could communicate effectively with users from diverse
          backgrounds. This highlighted the need to blend AI capabilities with
          human-like empathy to make healthcare information more approachable.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Presenting and Delivering Ideas</h2>
        <p>
          Through the development of YUPI, we learned valuable skills in
          presenting and advocating for our ideas like putting the demonstration
          up-front to build the context. The necessity to pitch our design to
          stakeholders, integrating their feedback, and iterating under tight
          deadlines taught us the importance of clarity and persuasion in
          communication and also the importance of software and soft skills.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Design for All Abilities</h2>
        <p>
          A central takeaway from working on YUPI was the importance of
          inclusivity in design. We were committed to ensuring that YUPI was
          accessible to individuals of all abilities, which led us to
          incorporate features like language translation, sign language
          recognition, and visual aids. This commitment deepened our
          understanding of accessibility issues and pushed us to innovate
          continuously, making sure that no user is left behind in the
          healthcare conversation.

        <p>
          Collaborating on YUPI has reinforced the value of a multi-disciplinary
          team. Despite similar background as international students, each
          member brought unique insights, resources and skillsets that enriched
          the project.
